Use structural comments in ALL CAPS followed by a horizontal dash line scaffold to visually segment code. Place these above every function and major logical block.

If the function or block is longer, put 1-2 more lines of regular comments right below the structural comment with dashes.

Example format:
// DATA NORMALIZATION ------------------------------------------------------

Comments are mandatory and frequent. Prefer single-line comments placed immediately above the operation they describe. Comments explain why and what, never restate syntax.

Code blocks subsections shall be also commented if they represent isolated self-contained logic.

Always put the dash-line after the structural comment to give the file horizontal scafolding

In JSX, every elemented should be commented with the structural comment which includes the dashed line
