Code Style Directive

Minimize structural noise. Use the fewest possible braces and parentheses while preserving correctness and readability. Prefer inline blocks and single-expression constructs over multiline forms.

Minimize line breaks. Combine logically related statements on one line when comprehension is not degraded. Use comma syntax deliberately to express tight sequencing, never to obscure logic.

Favor dense, streamlined code. Reduce vertical sprawl while keeping logical grouping intact. Density is a goal; opacity is not.

Avoid stylistic excess. Do not overuse comma syntax, chaining, or inline conditionals when they reduce traceability.

Every line must justify its existence. No ornamental formatting, no redundant structure, no implied behavior.

Never use single letter variable names.
