Use the least amount of brackets and line breaks. use comma syntax and try to put as many code as possible on a single line, while commenting the code thoroughly. Use short comments in the following format (replace with actual comment) "------------------------" <- including the dashes for visual structure. Never put into comments what you did for the finished task. Only put comments, that will be kept, so that i dont have to go through everything and delete comment garbage. Prepend SQL queries with the /_sql_/ flag so that they get automaticaly colored .
